# Git Flow

```git pull```   
updates your local repo with what has been stored in main repo

```git add .```   
all changes made in your local repo will be "staged" for commiting

```git status```   
track what files on your local repo are currently unstaged/staged

```git commit -m [short present-tense message]```   
commits all staged changes to your local repo

```git push```  
updates the main repo with the current version of your local repo
<br/></br>

# Git Branching

It may be helpful to work in your own branch on a specific feature until it is verified and complete. After a specific feature is verified and complete, that branch can be merged with the main branch.

```git branch [branch name]```   
if including [branch name], it will automatically create (if not found) and checkout that branch (use the command without [branch name] to see list of branches)
